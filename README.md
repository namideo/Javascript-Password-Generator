# Javascript-Password-Generator

## Assignment To create a password generator using javascript which prompts the user to create a random password by selecting criteria. 

1. First we create variables in order to establish our criteria (i.e. lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters). 
2. Next I created variables based on different choices, each with its own window prompt, followed by an "if" statement to validate each criteria based on the user's selection.
3. Then, we validate the input for the password generator to choose characters from the selected criteria above at random. 
4. A password will be generated matching the selected criteria and will be displayed on the page.
